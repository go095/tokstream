<h1>tokstream Documentation</h1>
<p>
<h3 align="center">1.0 </h3>The <em><a class="el" href="structtokstream.html" title="Token stream data structure.">tokstream</a></em> library is a simple, flexible and fast tokenizer written in C.<p>
It contains only one struct, <a class="el" href="structtokstream.html" title="Token stream data structure.">tokstream</a>, and a number of associated functions, which are all prefixed with a <code>ts_</code> tag.<h2><a class="anchor" name="building">
Building</a></h2>
Since the library consists of nothing more than a pair of header and implementation files, the easiest solution is to directly compile it with your project.<p>
If you, however, prefer to compile <em><a class="el" href="structtokstream.html" title="Token stream data structure.">tokstream</a></em> as a library, refer to the <a class="el" href="index.html#folders">CMake folder</a>.<h2><a class="anchor" name="folders">
Folder structure</a></h2>
You are currently seeing documentation from the <em>doc</em> folder of the library. The <code>Doxyfile</code> for building documentation is also located there.<p>
A <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file for building the library with <a href="http://www.cmake.org/" target="_blank">CMake</a> can be found in the <em>CMake</em> folder.<p>
The sources are located in the <em><a class="el" href="structtokstream.html" title="Token stream data structure.">tokstream</a></em> folder.<h2><a class="anchor" name="license">
License</a></h2>
The <em><a class="el" href="structtokstream.html" title="Token stream data structure.">tokstream</a></em> library is released under the MIT License:<p>
